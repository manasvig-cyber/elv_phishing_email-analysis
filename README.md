Phishing Email Analysis - README
Overview
This project focuses on the systematic examination and evaluation of suspicious emails to determine if they are phishing attempts.
Phishing attacks involve deceptive messages crafted to trick recipients into revealing confidential data or installing malicious software.

Acquire a Sample Phishing Email
Instead of relying solely on online repositories, samples were sourced directly from my email account’s spam and trash folders. 
This allowed the identification of real-world suspicious messages for analysis.

Inspect the Sender’s Email Address for Forgery
Careful scrutiny was applied to the sender’s address to identify signs of impersonation or spoofing.
For example, subtle spelling differences such as "rnicrosoft" versus "microsoft" can deceive users and warrant closer inspection.

Analyze Email Headers for Anomalies
Email headers provide crucial metadata about the message's origin and authentication. 
Tools such as Zoho Email Header Analyzer, Mailmodo Analyzer, and Sendmarc Analyzer were used to 
inspect headers obtained from the "View original" email option.

Validate Email Authentication Results
Authentication protocols—SPF, DKIM, and DMARC—were checked with a passing result expected. 
A "Fail" in the Received-SPF field or discrepancies in the source IP or routing paths often indicate potential email forgery.

Detect Suspicious URLs or Attachments
Manual hovering over embedded links helped confirm if URLs matched the sender's legitimate domain. 
Executable or compressed file attachments (.exe, .zip), localhost references, or unrelated domains are strong warning signs of phishing.

Recognize Urgent or Threatening Wording
Phishers often pressure or frighten recipients using claims like "Your account will be deactivated in 24 hours" or 
"Immediate verification required to prevent penalties." These social engineering tactics aim to bypass rational assessment.

Identify Spelling and Grammar Errors
Even if official logos or signatures appear authentic, phishing emails frequently exhibit grammatical mistakes, inconsistent capitalization,
or odd phrasing. These linguistic flaws serve as indicators of malicious intent.

Summary
Phishing email analysis entails a detailed review of sender authenticity, technical email validations, and content quality to ascertain legitimacy. 
This assessment combines scanning of email headers and authentication protocols with content evaluation focusing on language, embedded links, and attachments.
The objective is to classify the email correctly, enabling appropriate defensive measures such as blocking hostile senders or alerting end-users, thus enhancing cybersecurity posture.
