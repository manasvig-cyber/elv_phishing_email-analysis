ELEVATE LABS ASSIGNMENT 2

Performing a phishing email analysis:
Step 1:
 Obtain a Sample Phishing Email

I searched many sample phishing emails through online tools like Phsihing.org and caniphish sites 
to find mails treated as examples and study purposes.
But i did not find an effective one so i analyzed my mailbox and trash, spam section and found
few suspicious mails and decided to analyze them.

STEP 2:
Examine the Sender’s Email Address for Spoofing

Analyze Sender’s email address 
sometimes microsoft rnicrosoft 
looks very similar in the begging but needs proper examination as one can be 
tricked into sharing sensitive information.
Briefly check for changes or difference from the original address

Step 3:
Check Email Headers for Discrepancies
Email headers reveal where the email came from and whether it passed authentication.

You can use online tools like:
Zoho Email Header Analyzer​
Mailmodo Analyzer​
Sendmarc Analyzer

Check for email header at View original ->Show headers
We can obtain the entire info by copy paste to clipboard and analyze it through the tools mentioned

Step 4:
Review is done for
SPF, DKIM, DMARC results → should be “Pass.”
The “Received-SPF” line: “Fail” means it may be spoofed.
Source IP or route mismatches — suspicious if it’s inconsistent with the company’s domain.

Step 4: Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments
Hover (don’t click) over any link to see the real destination URL.

Analyze .exe .zip or localhost or the domain names of the links do not 
match the Sender’s company names

Step 5: Look for Urgent or Threatening Language
Phishing tactics rely on pressure or fear to make users act quickly.

Look for terms like:

“Your account will be suspended in 24 hours.”
“Verify immediately to avoid penalty.”
“Your payment has failed. Update now.”
These are social engineering cues used to bypass rational decision-making.

Step 7: Verify Spelling or Grammar Errors

Attackers often make slight errors in phrasing, capitalization, 
and punctuation.
Even if corporate logos or signatures appear correct, writing inconsistencies are common giveaways.

Summary:
Phishing email analysis is the process of carefully examining a suspicious message to determine whether it is fraudulent or malicious.
The investigation involves both technical and content-based checks to uncover deceptive indicators and confirm if the sender or links 
cannot be trusted.

It starts by inspecting the sender’s details to verify whether the originating domain and address are legitimate. 
Spoofed domains, mismatched “From” and “Reply-To” fields, or strange subdomains often indicate fraudulent intent. 
Analysts also analyze the email header, reviewing received paths, IPs, and authentication results such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. 
Any failure in these checks suggests potential spoofing or message tampering
Next, the email’s content and structure are evaluated. Messages containing grammatical errors, unfamiliar logos, fake security warnings,
 or emotional manipulation like urgency and threats are typical red flags. The analyst then reviews embedded links and attachments, 
 hovering over links to reveal hidden domains and examining file types. Suspicious items may be uploaded to sandbox tools or URL scanners
(like Any.Run or URLScan) to see if they demonstrate malicious behavior.

Finally, all observations are summarized, noting indicators such as spoofed senders, mismatched URLs, malicious attachments, or failed security checks. The goal is to classify the email as legitimate or phishing and determine response actions, such as blocking the sender or informing affected users.
